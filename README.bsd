20171226:	A first version of the FreeBSD port infrastructure

I have created a first version of the infrastructure needed to install
mg3a from the ports. Files are part of the 02-Makefile.bsd patch

To install mg3a on FreeBSD using the ports:

git clone <repo>
cd mg3a
quilt push -a
cd sys/bsd
sudo make install
sudo make clean
