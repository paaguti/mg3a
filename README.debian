The debian/ directory will allow you to create a .deb pacakge for mg3a
in your Debian based distribution. You can then install it using dpkg.

CAVEATs: new debian features are included as quilt patches. 
         This way I can preserve the original mg3a code

         I usually create the .deb package the lazy way with
         fakeroot debian/rules clean binary
         Purists can always improve this ;-)
