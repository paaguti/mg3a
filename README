This is mg3a, a MicroGNUEmacs clone. The original work was by Bengt Larsson.
Once the original source became unavailable and the author out of reach,
I decided to continue with the editor and make it publicly available
through github.
The first commit in github is Bengt Larsson's original code.
Anything after that is my work.

Currently mg3a is tested and developed both on Linux and macOS.
I use my own fork for the Rudix package manager to compile and
install it on my macOS machines. Linux development is done on a
stock Ubuntu 20.04 machine and tested on several Debian and Ubuntu
deplyments.
