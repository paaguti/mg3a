Some scripts I use. Should work with a modern /bin/sh. Works in any
case with /bin/bash.


mgfunc string [files]

Search for the string as an identifier at the beginning of a line in
files, and start the editor, going there. This can be a function name,
if you format things that way. The files default to *.c.


mgedit string [files]

Start the editor with the files containing the string. The files
default to *.c. The search string of the editor is set to the string.


mgt string [files]

Search for the string "Tag:string" in files, and start the editor,
going there. The files default to *.h *.c.


Changed 2015-01-01: "LC_ALL=C" in the scripts is so that grep won't think
that something with a non-locale charset is a binary file.
