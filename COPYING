Refer to $PREFIX/share/docs/mg3a/orig/README for the conditions
under which the original mg code was developed. This version is
free to use and distribute. With free as in beer. I found the
program to be useful for me and didn't want it do disappear.
Nothing more, nothing less. I do not accept any responsibility
for anything it may do to your system. If you use it, you agree
that you and only you are responsible for anything that may happen.
